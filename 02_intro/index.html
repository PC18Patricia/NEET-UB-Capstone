  ### Week 2: Scoping the Problem 

  What are the type(s) of households where your ideas can make a large impact?
  Gers and more permanent, simple homes that still burn coal in the traditional stove
  There are more compact, more efficient briquette-burning stoves that donâ€™t work with the current salt brick form factor. 
  What is the energy consumption mixture of these households? How has it changed in the past few years, do you expect it to change further in the next few years, and if so, how?
  Number of people moving into capital increasing, number of people in gers decreasing
  More domestic efforts to use renewable energy
  Diversifying away from coal a bit, but not significant change in the future
  Coal used heavily
  How do people meet their energy needs now? What is their purchasing power required to do so? How will that affect your design solution?
  Natural gas is expensive, coal is cheaper, cost of electricity is subsidized but burns lots of coal
  What resources are available to you to help meet people's energy needs in a carbon-neutral way? These include physical, intellectual, social, and logistical resources already available.
  Coal delivery system/infrastructure currently available
  Are people getting coal everyday? How well does it translate to daily retrieval of a salt brick? 
  What range of combinations of energy provision and energy reduction do you think are feasible?
  What are the key rates and mechanisms of energy loss in providing carbon-free energy to the people of Ulaanbaatar? How can you mitigate those to lessen the burden on your design solution?
  Insulation of ger, insulation of brick during transportation, directing heat to where it's actually useful, how are these thing locally insulated
  Who will be the stakeholders in your solution? Who will have to spend how much money when, and who will make how much money when? Will everyone be willing to do their part, particularly those who have to spend (1) cap-ex up front, and (2) op-ex for the foreseeable future?
  Government investment - political capital
  Keeping it cheap for the end user
