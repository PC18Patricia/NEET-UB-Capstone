  ### Week 2: Scoping the Problem 

  * What are the type(s) of households where your ideas can make a large impact?
    * We are focusing on gers and more permanent, simple homes that still burn coal in traditional Mongolian stoves. 
    * There are more compact, more efficient briquette-burning stoves that donâ€™t work with the current salt brick form factor. We would like to modify the salt brick to work with these stoves as well.  
  
  * What is the energy consumption mixture of these households? How has it changed in the past few years, do you expect it to change further in the next few years, and if so, how?
    * Coal is used heavily. The country is diversifying away from coal a bit, but not significant change is expected in the future. 
    * There are more domestic efforts to use renewable energy. 
    * The number of people moving into the capital is increasing, while the number of people in gers is decreasing.

  * How do people meet their energy needs now? What is their purchasing power required to do so? How will that affect your design solution?
    * Natural gas is expensive, while coal is cheaper. The cost of electricity is subsidized but people still burn lots of coal. Cost is important. 

  * What resources are available to you to help meet people's energy needs in a carbon-neutral way? These include physical, intellectual, social, and logistical resources already available.
    * The current coal delivery system or infrastructure can be leveraged for delivering salt bricks. We need to think about how often people are getting coal currently. This will affect their willingness and ability for daily retrieval of a salt brick. We need to think about prolonging the heat of the salt brick to minimize the number of trips per week. 

  * What are the key rates and mechanisms of energy loss in providing carbon-free energy to the people of Ulaanbaatar? How can you mitigate those to lessen the burden on your design solution?
    * Once the salt brick leaves the furnace, it will start to lose heat, thus it needs to be insulated during transportation. We will need to think about insulating the truck and locally insulating the brick during the last leg of transport from the distribution point to gers. 
    * Heat will also be lost through the walls of the ger and insulation will help reduce heat loss. 
    * Once the brick is in the stove, it probably still needs insulation to direct its heat to where it's useful. 

  * Who will be the stakeholders in your solution? Who will have to spend how much money when, and who will make how much money when? Will everyone be willing to do their part, particularly those who have to spend (1) cap-ex up front, and (2) op-ex for the foreseeable future?
    * Key stakeholders include the government, people living in gers, coal power plants, people along the coal delivery chain, etc. 
    * We expect that there will be government investment and political capital to get the project in motion. 
    * The goal is to keep the prices low for the end users who live in the gers.
