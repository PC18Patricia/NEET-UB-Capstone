  ### Week 5: Process of Solution Documentation

  #### Phase 1: Inner City 
  *Aimed at providing a proof of concept, delivering to easily-accessible gers close to the power plant* 

  1. Salt bricks get heated up in the coal power plant using waste heat. 
  2. Heated salt brick is placed inside an insulated box for transport. 
  3. Insulated trucks deliver insulated salt brick to each individual ger into the stove. 
  4. As brick cools, layers of insulation are removed to continue heating the ger. 
  5. Cold brick is picked up and delivered back to power plant for reheating. 

  
  #### Phase 2: Remote Terrain 
  *Continued expansion of program to reach more remote areas with more difficult-to-navigate terrain* 

  1. Salt bricks get heated up in the coal power plant using waste heat. 
  2. Heated salt brick is placed inside an insulated box for transport. 
  3. Insulated trucks deliver insulated salt brick to distribution points in ger districts. 
  4. Ger residents utilize hand truck to transport the brick to their individual ger into the stove. 
  5. As brick cools, layers of insulation are removed to continue heating the ger. 
  6. Ger residents bring cold brick back to the distribution point. 
  7. Truck picks up cold bricks and deliver them back to power plant for reheating.
