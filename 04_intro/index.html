### Week 4: Conflicting Variables and Resolution


#### Conflicting

  * Cost versus convenience 
  
  * Multiple smaller bricks means easier transport, but more steel needed so more expensive 
  
  * More complex cart means more convenience and easier for users to lift bricks but also more cost 
  
  * Larger salt brick means longer heating but is more difficult to transport 
  
  * More complex brick shape means easier carrying but is more difficult to manufacture and thus more expensive 
  
  * A single larger brick is better than multiple smaller bricks
    * Cost is an important factor
    * Logistics of keeping the small bricks insulated and hot until ready to use is complicated
    * The cart can help solve the issue of needing to lift the heavy brick

#### Things for Thought

  * The salt brick is about 20 pounds, so if children are to transport it, much of the lifting will need to be provided through mechanical advantage from the cart 
  
  * Possible ways to lift the brick from the cart
    * step on lever to pull cable over pulley, with cable hooked to top of brick
    * winch to pull cable attached to top of brick
  
  * Getting the cart over the threshold 
    * modification to the wheels  
    * cart tips or rotates over threshold

  * Insulation is needed on the individual brick throughout the entire transportation process 
  
  * Insulation Properties 
    * withstand the 600 C 
    * have the mechanical strength to be able to hold when the salt brick is being lifted 
    * Form insulation comes in - sheets, batts, formed/molded shapes? 
    * Going around the brick - detachable panels, box with cover, bag? 
    * Manufacturing - locations and methods of connecting seams and edges 
  
  * Can we reduce the cost of the multiple smaller bricks if we used a different metal?
