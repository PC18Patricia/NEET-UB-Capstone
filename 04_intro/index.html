  ### Week 4: Conflicting Variables and Resolution


  **Conflicting**

  * Cost versus convenience 
  * Multiple smaller bricks means easier transport, but more steel needed so more expensive 
  * More complex cart means more convenience and easier for users to lift bricks but also more cost 
  * Larger salt brick means longer heating but is more difficult to transport 
  * More complex brick shape means easier carrying but is more difficult to manufacture and thus more expensive 
  
  **Things for Thought** 

  * The salt brick is about 20 pounds, so if children are to transport it, much of the lifting will need to be provided through mechanical advantage from the cart 
  * Insulation is needed on the individual brick throughout the entire transportation process 
    * Properties 
      * withstand the 600C 
      * have the mechanical strength to be able to hold when the salt brick is being lifted 
    * Form insulation comes in - sheets, batts, formed/molded shapes? 
    * Going around the brick - detachable panels, box with cover, bag? 
    * Manufacturing - locations and methods of connecting seams and edges 
  * Can we reduce the cost of the multiple smaller bricks if we used a different metal? 
  * Getting the cart over the threshold 
    * modification to the wheels  
    * cart tips or rotates over threshold
