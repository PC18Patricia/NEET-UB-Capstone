  ### Week 7: Design Review Reflection  

  #### Insulation  
  * an important part of the logistics, but hadn't been really addressed  
  * greatly determines the handling/transportation and how heat will be transmitted in the ger  
  * need to pivot to focus more on developing this more  
  * rockwool  
      * used in Mongolia for ger insulation  
      * made assumption to start off with it as the insulative material  
      * investigate more alternative materials  
      * confirm burning/bad smell from experiment  
  * insulating fire bricks  
      * could provide structure where rockwool can't  
      * could be useful corner pieces for insulating box  
      * need to look at manufacturing process and othr alternatives to confirm cost and manufacturability  
  * wire mesh  
      * currently envision chicken wire or wire fencing  
      * could help add structural soundness without adding too much weight or cost  

  #### Cart  
  * currently have a design to prototype  
  * need to pivot away from designing cart  
    * insulation issue is more important  
    * not really needed for the first phase of implementing this solution  
  * will probably be tabled for the next group that works on furthering the solution
